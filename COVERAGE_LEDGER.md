# qyl Auto-Instrumentation — Coverage Ledger & Milestone Gates

> Operating contract (locked):
> 1. **Total coverage** — every blueprint box has a row + status here. A box with no row is a bug.
>    `out-of-scope` is permitted *only* with a written reason. Silent drops are forbidden.
> 2. **Per-milestone gates** — a milestone is `proven` only when BOTH gates are green.
>    The next milestone MUST NOT start until the prior is `proven`.
>
> Decision locked (v0.2.0-pre.1 substrate swap): **runtime = pure-managed library**, AOT-native.
> Source generators + `DiagnosticListener` subscriptions + `[ModuleInitializer]` replace the
> external CLR profiler / IL-rewriting substrate that backed M1–M12 of the v0.1.0 series.

## Gate definitions (unchanged)

| Gate | Name | Pass condition |
|------|------|----------------|
| A | Golden-OTLP | Emitted signals → canonical OTLP, volatile fields normalized (TraceId/SpanId/timestamps/durations/host.*), diffed against checked-in golden. **Zero semantic diff.** |
| B | No-behavior-change | App run WITH vs WITHOUT a reference to `Qyl.AutoInstrumentation.Hosting`: identical stdout, stderr, exit code, exceptions (thrown+caught), return values. **App-invisible.** |

Gate B is captured **baseline-first**: the WITHOUT-reference run is recorded *before* any
`PackageReference` is added.

## Status legend
`proven` done+gated · `M1`/`M{n}` scheduled to that milestone · `in-progress` · `decided` (design fixed, no code) ·
`reuse` (inherited from BCL primitives — qyl writes none) · `cross-cutting` (enforced by every gate) ·
`backlog` (has a home, not yet scheduled — assigned to a milestone before work starts) ·
`archived` (proven under v0.1.0 substrate, see `v0.1.0-archive` tag) ·
`oos:<reason>` (explicitly dropped, reason required)

## Milestones (post-swap)

| Milestone | Goal | Gate A golden | Gate B baseline | State |
|-----------|------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **M1 AOT walking skeleton** | A NativeAOT-published consumer app, with a `PackageReference` to `Qyl.AutoInstrumentation.Hosting`, emits ONE HttpClient CLIENT span via `QylActivitySource` to a console listener — driven by the `HttpHandlerDiagnosticListener` subscription. | one CLIENT span: method/url/server | app stdout/exit identical w/wo the reference + 0 spans in the control arm | **in-progress** — PackageReference zero-code NativeAOT boot + deterministic offline HttpClient activity golden are proven by `tools/verify-nativeaot-consumer-golden.py`; deterministic Gate B consumer runner exists in `tools/verify-consumer-behavior.py`; `tools/verify-aot-autoinstrumentation-goal.py` runs the current combined goal gate. Full OTLP export normalizer still pending. |
| M2+ | *not enumerated until M1 is `proven`* (the principle) | — | — | — |

## 60-item OpenTelemetry .NET auto-instrumentation contract

Source of truth:

- `docs/otel-dotnet-auto-60-contract-items.yaml`
- `src/Qyl.AutoInstrumentation.SourceGenerators/InstrumentationContract.cs`

Current compile-time NativeAOT classification:

| Contract slice | Count | Current binding |
|---|---:|---|
| Signal-specific promises | 37 | 33 source-generated signal promises plus 4 unsupported NativeAOT parity/dynamic promises. |
| Source-generated signal promises | 33 | `QylAutoInstrumentationGenerator` gates interceptor targets through `InstrumentationContract.TryGetSourceGeneratedSignal`. |
| Unsupported NativeAOT parity/dynamic signal promises | 4 | `signals.traces.ASPNET`, `signals.traces.WCFCORE`, `signals.traces.WCFSERVICE`, `signals.metrics.ASPNET`; retained in the manifest but rejected by the source-generator target gate. |
| Global environment controls | 7 | `QylAutoInstrumentationOptions` reads global/signal defaults and derives signal-specific pattern variables. |
| Instrumentation options | 16 | `QylAutoInstrumentationOptions` reads all option environment variables; raw/sensitive emissions stay default-off. |
| Total contract items | 60 | `InstrumentationContract.TotalCount`. |

Unsupported NativeAOT parity/dynamic paths are not backlog emitters. These items require .NET
Framework, bytecode/runtime rewriting, or runtime dispatch surfaces that this generator explicitly
does not implement. Treating them as source-generated work would violate the architecture rule: no
CLR profiling, no startup hooks, no runtime IL rewriting, no reflection, and no dynamic dispatch.

The source-generated signal set covers source-visible call-sites and meter registration only.
Third-party binary internals and unsupported/dynamic call paths remain intentionally ignored.

## Archived (v0.1.0 substrate) milestones

The following 12 milestones are `archived` — proven under the v0.1.0 substrate (CLR profiler +
`OTEL_DOTNET_AUTO_PLUGINS`) and reproducible from tag `v0.1.0-archive`. They are preserved here
as the historical audit trail; their *gates* (Gate A / Gate B) port forward unchanged, their
*mechanism* does not.
